This is the San Joaquin River Basin Summary for the period between START_DATE and END_DATE, based on iSnobal model simulation, and input data from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) atmospheric model from NOAA. The reporting domain covers the San Joaquin River Basin, and includes the Main San Joaquin, Jose Creek, Willow Creek and South Fork sub-basins. The total amount of water stored in the snowpack as of END_DATE is estimated to be \textbf{TOTAL_SWE UNITS}, which represents a change of \textbf{TOTAL_SWEDEL UNITS} of snow storage during the reporting period.
