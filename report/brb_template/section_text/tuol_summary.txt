This is the Tuolumne River Basin Snowpack Summary for the period between START_DATE and END_DATE, based on iSnobal model simulation. The reporting domain covers the Tuolumne River basin upstream of Hetch Hetchy reservoir, the Cherry Creek basin upstream of Cherry Lake and Eleanor basin upstream of Lake Eleanor. Extended Tuolumne refers to the total of all three basins. The total amount of water stored in the snowpack as of END_DATE is estimated to be TOTAL_SWE UNITS, which represents a change of TOTAL_SWEDEL UNITS of snow storage during the reporting period.
