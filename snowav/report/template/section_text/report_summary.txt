This is the default Snowpack Summary for the period between START_DATE and END_DATE, based on iSnobal model simulation. \\

Consider making your own reportsummary.txt and referencing it in the config file, because CatBus can only do so much. \\ 

The total amount of water stored in the snowpack as of END_DATE is estimated to be \textbf{TOTAL_SWE UNITS}, which represents a change of \textbf{TOTAL_SDEL UNITS} of snow storage during the reporting period. \\
